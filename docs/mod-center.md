# Mod center

`/mods` provides an administrator-controlled **package library**, not authority
over the existing shared inference service. Public access is read-only.

## Delivered operations

- A Workstation UI projection of the generated 19-entry organization feed at
  `vllm-hust-dev-hub/config/extension-catalog-v1.json`. The projection pins the
  dev-hub commit and feed SHA256, then tests every ID, repository, source commit,
  availability decision and immutable installation commit against that feed.
- The organization feed itself is parsed by the published Extension Manager
  catalog validator at the exact Manager commit recorded in
  `config/mod-catalog.v1.json`. Workstation's TypeScript parser validates its UI
  projection only; it is not presented as the Extension Manager validator.
- Prepare each extension and pinned Extension Manager in an isolated artifact-validation venv, using
  GitHub codeload archives addressed by full commit SHA (not Git branch tips).
  Build only the reviewed sources; record resulting wheel SHA256 values. Build
  isolation dependencies are resolved from PyPI, so this is source-pinned, not a
  claim of bit-identical rebuilds. No vLLM/Ascend dependencies are installed.
- Validate installed manifests through Extension Manager without loading the
  plugin. Save configuration, enable/disable **intent**, and persistent task logs.
- Failed configure/enable restores the preceding Manager state. Failed install
  leaves a private `.install-*` directory for diagnosis, never a valid install.
- Uninstall refuses enabled intent and moves the entire isolated installation
  into `archive/<mod>-<task>` after forgetting Manager configuration. Archive
  remains recoverable and consumes storage; nothing shared is deleted.

The venv is packaging isolation, **not a security sandbox**: trusted build code
runs as the workstation user. No credentials or host Python/pip environment are
forwarded. Source changes require code review and a new explicit SHA. There is
no arbitrary URL, shell command, package name or source-ref API.

## Re-listing gates

An ECPA 0.3 package can return to the visible plugin page as a `preview` after
its merged repository commit and packaged manifest path are pinned in both the
organization feed and this projection. Preview cards are discoverable but have
no deployment pin and expose no prepare/configure action. Promotion to
`available` is a separate change requiring an immutable installation descriptor
plus current-baseline functional and recovery evidence. Import success,
enablement intent, or an environment variable is never runtime-effective
evidence, and performance remains a separate axis.

## Deployment

Create an operator-owned mode-0700 directory on an appropriately sized disk:

```dotenv
WORKSTATION_MOD_DIR=/absolute/operator-owned/mod-library
# Optional: defaults to /usr/bin/python3; requires Python 3.10+ with venv/pip.
WORKSTATION_MOD_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
# Optional: default scripts/mod_worker.py is included in standalone output.
# WORKSTATION_MOD_WORKER=/absolute/path/scripts/mod_worker.py
```

Use the existing private administrator password. All POSTs require the shared
admin header; invalid supplied credentials also fail on GET. Passwords remain
page-memory-only. The Python worker holds a process-wide filesystem lock across
each operation, bounds individual subprocesses to five minutes and the task to
15 minutes. Stale jobs project interrupted after 20 minutes. This service uses
a single host-local store; do not share it between multiple uncoordinated hosts.

## Read-only compatibility API

Every `GET /api/mods` catalog entry reports three independent objects:

- `artifactQualification`: model/topology-scoped functional evidence for the
  reviewed candidate artifact;
- `currentRuntimeCompatibility`: whether the current instance has both exact
  qualified Core/Ascend provenance and a candidate runtime-effective witness; and
- `currentRuntimeState`: the live instance's separate `installed`, `configured`,
  `enabled`, and `runtimeEffective` observations.

The API intentionally has no ambiguous `qualification`, `currentCompatibility`,
or `state` aliases. An uninstalled, disabled, or unobserved Mod reports `unknown`,
not `compatible` or `incompatible`. `currentRuntimeState.installed` means only that a prepared library
artifact exists; it does not mean that a target worker loaded the package.
`runtimeEffective` requires owner-bound deployment plus observed target-worker
execution. Effectiveness measurements are also separate and are qualified only
for their explicit configuration/workload cell.

## Explicitly not delivered: inference run/apply

`POST /api/mods` with `action: run` returns **409**, even for administrators.
No Docker, device, systemd, engine launch, restart or external-service delete
command is reachable through the worker. Installed and enabled never mean active.
The page displays runtime as **unverified**, not inactive or healthy.

Closing this gate requires a separately owned target instance, exact core/plugin
compatibility evidence, resource admission, operator-confirmed restart, runtime
loading evidence and an observed rollback. Current shared Sage Mate/statecentric
instances are explicitly outside this feature's mutation scope. External KV
services remain separately operated. Multi-Mod composition needs provider/domain
conflict checks; separate library venvs are not a combination compatibility claim.

## Isolated lifecycle canary

When the host operator separately enables the fixed `inert-canary` broker policy,
administrators can run start, stop, restart and retained-baseline rollback from the
Mod Center after a second password confirmation. This is a real CPU Python process
with AF_UNIX health, PID/start-ticks identity, controller plan/approval,
generation/CAS/fencing and one-use launch grants. It has no model, TCP listener,
container, service target or accelerator access and always reports Mod
`effective=false`.

The canary proves only the broker and UI control path. Its availability is never
projected onto the shared Qwen instance: production apply, disable and rollback
remain hidden and return 409 until that exact instance has an enrolled qualified
backend, owner fencing, rollback baseline and worker execution evidence.

Manager configure accepts only `launch_options` here, not caller-supplied
compatibility or health assertions. DiffSpec needs
`launch_options.speculative_config.model`; model existence is a later target
admission check. Empty configuration is permitted for BidKV/LatchMoE and does not
mean that runtime-specific offload/model parameters have been validated.

## Verification

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -v
npm run build
node scripts/check_standalone.mjs
# Opt-in real package lifecycle, in a dedicated empty directory; no NPU use:
node scripts/test_mod_lifecycle.mjs /absolute/empty/test-directory
```

Browser audit: `scripts/audit/mod-center.js` through Playwright CLI `run-code`.
Admin browser fixtures intercept every mutation; real package lifecycle is
tested separately. Neither is evidence of real plugin inference.
